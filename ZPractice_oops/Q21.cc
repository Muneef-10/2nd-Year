/*In a university, a University has multiple Departments. Define a University class that 
aggregates multiple Department objects. Each department has properties like name, facultyCount, 
and headOfDepartment. The university "has" departments, but departments can exist 
independently.
Note: The University aggregates Department objects, where the departments are part of the 
university but exist independently (e.g., a department might be transferred or merged with another 
university).*/
