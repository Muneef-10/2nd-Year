/*Q-16) Create a hotel room booking system where each room has attributes like room number, type (single/double), price, and availability status. 
The program should:
• Use a class Room to store room details.
• Use a pointer to a Room object to dynamically manage room records.
• Allow users to book a room, cancel a booking, and view available rooms.
• Ensure that a room cannot be double-booked.
• Display a summary of all rooms, including their booking status.*/
